            <p>Luke’s Lobster is a family-owned Maine seafood business, founded by third-generation lobsterman Luke Holden. Luke’s began as a tiny lobster roll shack in New York City, where Holden was unable to find an authentic, high quality Maine lobster roll to feed his craving for home in 2009. He, partner Ben Conniff, and their enterprising team launched and built their first ten shacks sourcing the world’s best lobster from fishermen through Luke’s father, Jeff’s seafood production business. 

                In 2013, the Luke’s team opened its own seafood purchasing and production business in Saco, Maine. This made Luke’s truly vertically integrated, buying direct from fishermen they know and trust and handling their seafood throughout the dock to plate journey.
                
                In 2018, Luke’s expanded into branded grocery, launching its flash-frozen lobster meat, tails, and seafood meals in grocery stores around the country. And in 2020, when restaurants were closing and markets for sustainable seafood vanishing, Luke’s launched its online market, to bring seafood direct from Maine to doorsteps around the country. Luke’s now has shack locations in ten US states, Japan, and Singapore, and continues to grow and spread its mission through new shacks, new grocery partners, and new online products. As we grow, we deepen our commitment to our core values, and keep our small family business mindset, with a commitment to putting stakeholders above profits, as you’ll see from our Certified B Corp status.</p>
